Decided to use Jupyter notebooks for ease of commenting and displaying Plots and output Dataframes

In this repo:

**data** folder: The input data provided

**outputs** folder: The output dataframes from Q1 and Q2

Question 3 and Question 4 can also be found in a .py file


They can be ran from terminal like this: 
- python3 question3.py - Here the example list with instructions is in the script
- python3 question4.py '2022-04-20 08:00' '2022-04-20 12:00' 'Energy' '30MIN'
